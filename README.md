# Adding the Runner Hub Mod to Hero Lab

**Warning:** This process has only been tested on the latest version of HL with all mods installed.
 
**Warning:** Once you start this process, save files using previous versions of this mod will not work until it is complete.

# Part 1: Adding the mod to Herolab

1. Remove any existing .user files from your game system data folder(If you are using mods other than this one you may want to leave those in place)

1. Create a blank new portfolio, and open the Configure Hero screen(ctrl+K)
1. Click “Click to change Hero settings”

1. Check all Runner Hub options, then click Set Defaults.

At this point all **new** portfolios will have the mod enabled automatically. 

Due to the nature of HL mods, **there are additional steps to convert your existing portfolios. For each pre-existing portfolio**, you need to load that portfolio, at which point you will probably get several errors. Close the errors, and press CTRL-K to bring up the hero configuration screen. Enable all of the RunnerHub options and click OK. Save a copy of your portfolio (you can overwrite your existing save if you feel brave) and you are done.
